# C Tutorial

Let's learn C together

## How to write a program
1. Define at a high level what the program should do
2. Be specific about what the program should do, for instance, provide example of how the program will be used "./program_name xxx"
3. [Optional] Write pseudo code (Add comment to describe what the program should do)
4. Write the code
5. Test and fix bugs

Note that this can be applied to functions as well.

If the program is big, consider building blocks by blocks. You can use the argument of the program to only execute a portion of the program to validate it is working as expected.
